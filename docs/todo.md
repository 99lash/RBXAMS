## „Çµ„Éº„Éê„Éº Backend To-Do List (Server-Side Logic & API)

This covers the logic needed on the server to support the UI features.

### Dashboard API
- [ ] Create endpoint (`/api/dashboard/summary`) for summary card data (Total Robux Bought/Sold, Profit) from the `daily_summary` table. [cite: 21]
- [ ] Create endpoint (`/api/dashboard/charts`) for chart data (e.g., daily profit for the last 30 days). [cite: 45]

### Accounts API Enhancements
- [ ] Update `findAll` endpoint to support **pagination**. [cite: 58]
- [ ] Add logic for **searching** by account name. [cite: 60]
- [ ] Add logic for **filtering** by status and date range. [cite: 61]

### Daily Activity Summary API
- [ ] Create endpoint (`/api/summary/daily`) for a paginated list of daily summaries. [cite: 94]
- [ ] Implement **date range filtering** for the daily summary endpoint. [cite: 95]

### Data Export Logic
- [ ] Create endpoint (`/api/accounts/export?format=csv`) to generate and download a CSV/Excel file of accounts. [cite: 121, 122]
- [ ] Create endpoint (`/api/summary/export?format=pdf`) to generate and download a CSV/PDF file of the daily summary. [cite: 123, 124]

### Features & Security
- [ ] Implement "Forgot Password" logic (token generation, email, password update). [cite: 117]
- [ ] (Optional) Create a `manifest.json` and basic `service-worker.js` to be served by the backend for PWA support. [cite: 151]
- [ ] (Optional) Create a scheduled task/cron job to check for accounts nearing their `unpend_date` for notifications. [cite: 4]

- [ ] Integrate a charting library (e.g., Chart.js) and display data from `/api/dashboard/charts`. [cite: 45]

### Account Management UI

- [ ] Make all pages **fully responsive** to be mobile-friendly. [cite: 17, 149]
- [ ] (Optional) Integrate PWA features into the main HTML to make the web app "installable." [cite: 118, 119]
